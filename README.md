## Project Goal

This project analyzes what makes a candy popular, using visual storytelling. With the help of Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, I dive into the sweet, sugary world of American candies to answer:

- Do people really like sugar that much?
- Which candies win the “most liked” crown?
- Is chocolate really queen or just hyped?
- What affects the winning percentage of a candy?

## Tools Used

- Python 
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook 

---

## Visuals Included

- Chocolate vs Win Rate 🍫  
- Sugar vs Price %  
- Bar Candies vs Popularity  
- Scatterplots, Pairplots & Heatmaps for deep comparison  
- And... a lot of hot pink color-coded plots 😎

---

## Key Findings

- Candies with chocolate and bar form generally win more.
- Sugar percentage has a weird love-hate relationship with popularity.
- Chocolate is the Beyoncé of candies but not undefeated.
- Visual aesthetics matter — in charts and candies 😌
